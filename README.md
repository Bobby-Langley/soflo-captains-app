## Welcome

There is a need for qualified, licensed captains in South Florida from first time boaters to even the most experienced, licensed captains.

The idea behind this app is to create a site where needed captains can be found to mitigate the constant search.

## Plans
There will be a login/log out for captains in order to create and profile and post their qualifications, information, desired jobs, and scheduled availability.

This info will be displayed on a main page where those visiting the site can see in order to find a captain and contact them.
